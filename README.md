This was an early demo of a eCommerce website for the sale of "Pisanka" eggs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisanka_(Polish))

The site uses jQuery to display a fluid and changing banner and to allow a slick sorting and zoom display of the product.  There is a background soundtrack that would autoplay, but I also included an audio control as this was about the time that browsers started clamping down on autoplay.
